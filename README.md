# Taskr

Taskr is a task management application that allows users to create choose from different categories and add tasks to them as they see fit. Users can view their tasks as cards or in a calendar form that has Month, Week, Day, and Agenda options. Currently the database being using is MongoDB but it will be converted to PostgreSQL using sequelize.

This application is using the Pro version of MDBReact. If you have the pro version replace "MDBReactPro_Key" in package.json in the client directory. If you do not have the pro version install mdbreact and replace the pro components.
